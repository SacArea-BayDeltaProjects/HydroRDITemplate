'UNIVERSAL PROGRAM -- May need some trimming!!! NOTE! THIS PROGRAM WILL NOT COMPILE ON CR1000 OS 28 or EARLIER!

'-----------------IMPORTANT IMPORTANT-----------------------------------------------
'BEFORE COMPILING:
' 1 SET DLD DATALOGGER TYPE IN TOOLS MENU FOR THE TARGET DATALOGGER
' 2 CHOOSE COSTOMIZE CONSTANTS IN TOOLS MENU, SELECT PROPER CONSTANTS FOR THE TARGET STATION
' 3 CHOOSE CONDITIONAL COMPILE AND SAVE IN THE COMPILE MENU. RENAME THE FILE WITH STATION ID AND DATE IN FILENAME USING CR6 or CR1 file extension
' 4 LOAD THE SAVED FILE INTO THE STATION DATALOGGER OR YOU CAN LOAD THE ORIGINAL DLD FILE IF SPACE PERMITS.
' 5 DO NOT USE A MAX232 ADAPTER ON THE CSI/0 (ComME) port

'Note: Pos Flow angle can only be used on 4 beam uplookers using EARTH coordinate transformation.
'its use in any other configuration is disabled after the first ensemble.
'If using BEAM coordinate transformation on a Channel Master, You MUST obtain an external HEADING determination as there is NO internal compass!
'If using a Bi-directional rating (Ebb/Flood) with different bins for each direction you must be using a channel master with insturment coordinates, you must set Birating to true in the startup parameters.
'You also must set StartBin, EndBin, StartEbbBin, EndEbbBin, StartFldBin, and EbbFldBin to appropriate values (ebb = pos) (Fld = neg)  Startbin and Endbin should include all the bins used
'for both ebb and flood calculations. You also have to set BiRatTran to the velocity That you wish calculations to switch from Ebb bins to Flood Bins. The program will make sure you are using
'a Channel Master with instrument coords before applying the Ebb/Flood bin differences. If you are using any other VM or coord system, it will use the standard method to calculate iVel.
'You can include V2 (Y velocity) in the IndexVel calculation if you wish to use it. Just make sure UseV2 is True.

'_______________________________PROGRAM UPDATES_________________________________________
'20190703 - MRI 4.00 Implemented easier to track program versioning with variable "ProgramVersion". Starting at 4.0. Adjustment of the version number should reflect severity of the changes made.
'20190705 - TAV 4.10 Added V1, V2, V3, V4 to DataOut table.
'20190709 - TAV 4.11 Increased buffer for SUNA port when it's opened to record data. Eliminated delay between opening the SerialIn command. Adjusted when the Suna gets turned off if it was manually turned on.
'20190710 - TAV 4.12 Added Program info to SVMaq table for easy access in case it's needed before midnight when QAQC gets written.
'20190711 - TAV 4.13 Put "MaxBins" in the Customize Constants section to more easily establish how many bins are wanted at the site.
'           TAV 4.20 Fixed some problems with conditional compiling if WqSonde = "NONE". Still some more work to do with other Customize Constant options.
'20190712 - MRI 4.21 Adjusted BinSpikes to pull from MaxBins variable to stop error when more than 27 bins are being collected. Fixed bug with top bottom sonde where the btm error flags would not reset after a power cycle.
'20190809 - MRI 4.22 Added FlowSign to the USR drive to prevent issue of incorrect flow sign being entered in the program, user reset in the field to be correct with the public table, and then a power cycle resets sign to original, incorrect value. 20190819-altered beamcheck table to be MaxBins*4 instead of just 108 incase we use more than 27 bins.
'20190903 - MRI 4.23 Added additional timers for ADVM process to help with further troubleshooting. Altered position of some timers out of If statements because if conditions were not met the timers would remain at the last value and not reset for each scan. This gave the appearance of processes happening "back in time"
'20191018 - MRI 4.24 Altered timing for the delay prior to taking the WQ serial burst sample to avoid skipped scans in a CR1000 due to its slower processing speed.
'20191022 - TAV 4.25 Altered SerialIn TimeOut for the SUNA to account for longer integration periods and potentially timing out before the next value comes in from the sensor. Also open the SunaPort before the scan so it's immediately dedicated as a ComPort (for emulator purposes).
'20191025 - MRI 4.30 Added backup iridium radio transmission capability for important sites. Done by turning the DCP into a SDI-12 sensor and taking Aquarius table data
'20191029 - TAV 4.40 Overhauled SUNA sampling to allow for stats to be calculated with less than 30 values as well as record good and bad data in separate tables.
'20191101 - MRI 4.41 In the scan moved the decodes section right after we take in the velocity data. After all ADVM routines are finished then continue on. This will allow decodes to occur while we wait for the burst to begin for a CR6. Hopefully this solves the timing issue. For CR1000s made it so there was no delay before doing the burst to help avoid skipped scans. Altered debugger table so all time follow the program order correctly.
'20191118 - MRI 4.42 Added ability to have a redundant sonde with all the same functions but completely seperate of a single sonde.

'IMPORTANT - SDI-12 Code should be commented out if program is not being used at Freeport Sites.  If program is being used at freeport then the SlaveCom master slave code (used for fish recievers) MUST be commented out
'IMPORTANT - ADCP should be set for 1 minute TE and WP 60.
'IMPORTANT - For EXO2 serial operation, A MAX232 adapter must be used on CR6 "U" ports or CR1000 Com1.Com2,Com3 or Com4. An ADCP can run on all ports, but
'            a MAX232 adapter should probably be used if using CR6 "U" ports or for long RS232 cables.
SequentialMode 'must not use pipeline mode or averages are missed
