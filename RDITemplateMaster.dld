'UNIVERSAL PROGRAM -- May need some trimming!!! NOTE! THIS PROGRAM WILL NOT COMPILE ON CR1000 OS 28 or EARLIER!

'-----------------IMPORTANT IMPORTANT-----------------------------------------------
'BEFORE COMPILING:
' 1 SET DLD DATALOGGER TYPE IN TOOLS MENU FOR THE TARGET DATALOGGER
' 2 CHOOSE COSTOMIZE CONSTANTS IN TOOLS MENU, SELECT PROPER CONSTANTS FOR THE TARGET STATION
' 3 CHOOSE CONDITIONAL COMPILE AND SAVE IN THE COMPILE MENU. RENAME THE FILE WITH STATION ID AND DATE IN FILENAME USING CR6 or CR1 file extension
' 4 LOAD THE SAVED FILE INTO THE STATION DATALOGGER OR YOU CAN LOAD THE ORIGINAL DLD FILE IF SPACE PERMITS.
' 5 DO NOT USE A MAX232 ADAPTER ON THE CSI/0 (ComME) port

'Note: Pos Flow angle can only be used on 4 beam uplookers using EARTH coordinate transformation.
'its use in any other configuration is disabled after the first ensemble.
'If using BEAM coordinate transformation on a Channel Master, You MUST obtain an external HEADING determination as there is NO internal compass!
'If using a Bi-directional rating (Ebb/Flood) with different bins for each direction you must be using a channel master with insturment coordinates, you must set Birating to true in the startup parameters.
'You also must set StartBin, EndBin, StartEbbBin, EndEbbBin, StartFldBin, and EbbFldBin to appropriate values (ebb = pos) (Fld = neg)  Startbin and Endbin should include all the bins used
'for both ebb and flood calculations. You also have to set BiRatTran to the velocity That you wish calculations to switch from Ebb bins to Flood Bins. The program will make sure you are using
'a Channel Master with instrument coords before applying the Ebb/Flood bin differences. If you are using any other VM or coord system, it will use the standard method to calculate iVel.
'You can include V2 (Y velocity) in the IndexVel calculation if you wish to use it. Just make sure UseV2 is True.

'20141204 - JBD Removed old code\comments and fixed minor bug in keypad menu,
'20141204 - JBD wrote code so YSI Locations cant be zero and cause "variable out of bounds error".
'20141208 - TAV changed "Trans" variable to a String in order to revert back to "NAN" in case of incidental changes
'20141216 - TAV testing to get rid of "LocStg" and "YsiStg" because the new EXOs have a pressure sensor, should be no need for these anymore
'               May look at keeping them to keep standardized program that'll work with 6600 or EXO, but turn them off when not needed.
'20150107 - TAV added code to check on the amount of memory left on WH recorder at 00:15 each day. Needed to be aware as WH won't
'               resume deployment if there's a power surge, etc. and there's no memory left.
'20150108 - TAV added a StgRef that will populate in the SiteVisit datatable so we know what the reference (staff or wire weight) at time of visit
'20150114 - TAV,DEA,AAD added variables to allow for an indicator if someone had a visual reference on the stage. Created counter for reference
'           to see how long ago the most recent visual refence on stage
'20150128 - TAV fixed bug in the bad stage flags, added "VisRefOK" to SiteVisit table to more easily see when someone got a reference
'20150205 - MRS Added Code for Bi-Directional rating (different bins depending on flow direction) BI-RATINGS CAN ONLY BE USE WITH CHANNEL MASTERS SET IN INSTRUMENT COODINATES
'20150211 - TAV added "WQVisit", "DiveVisit", and "DaysSince..." counters measurements, WQ, and Dive Visits in order to display values on RTMC

'20150219 - TAV added code to reset "HighMeas" and "LowMeas" to "False" if someone changes the high or low RatVels
'20150309 - TAV added code to automatically get pressure sensor and ADCP serial numbers as well as flags to indicate when a new instrument has been installed
'20150322 - MRS added code to decode the ADCP sn from the LongArray so wakeup and PS0 not needed
'20150406 - TAV added code to send specific flow data to a second datalogger (in this case Sac Waste Water). And send all data tables to a second datalogger in order to test satellite communications.
'20150513 - MRS added panel temperature to serial data out for SRWTP
'20150514 - MRS deleted serial code and added SDI-12 sensor code to output flow data to SRWTP slave data logger.
'20150921 - TAV Added SiteID to VelData Table. Added YSI data to 1min table, created trigger to turn on YSI data. Edited Stage processes. Now uses "StagePrime" to calculate discharge (as before), but instead of "StageSecnd"
'               there are "UpbeamStg", "VMPressStg", "PS1Stg, "PS2Stg", and "YsiStg" and the corresponding "TrueStg" and "Offset" for each. This will keep data in USGS database more organized.
'               Added VMUpbeam and VMTemp to Beamcheck data for Suspended Sediment Concentration studies
'20151013 - MRS Corrected YSI error bug where the sub bypassed the error even if ysi was not sending data.
'20151015 - MRS Beamcheck now recording every 15 mins the time (for sediment data)
'20151116 - MRS Added Code to restart EXO (via the CDMA relay) if ysi data is not present for an hour
'20151118 - TAV Lots of commenting to make program easier to understand. Deleted "StageSecnd" and Stage3" and associated variables. Left the subroutine (commented out)
'               for reference. Changed "OSVersion" to "OSVers". OS28 and higher have "OSVersion" as a constant, somewhere.
'20151203 - TAV Fixed a stage bug. Added "StageSecnd" back in for the sole purpose of getting the differences between stage values (to see if there's drift). Added a TempDiff variable for comparison of YSI and VM Temp.
'               Now the user will select the instrument used to calculate Q (with "SelStgUsed") and the instrument to compare to (with "SelStg2"). At most stations it should be PS1 and PS2. Still need to do some more clean up.
'               A couple edits to the WQ parameters made, added a second FDOM (one is FdomRFU, the other FdomQSU), YsiDO is now "YsiDOmgL". Fixed Keypad menu as well.
'20151228 - TAV Finished up some thorough cleanup. Dimmed a lot of Variables. MRS will dim others. Eliminated "Startup" datatable as it's never been used. Moved BaudRate and VemcoRTR into the scan so user can change on the fly
'               Deleted PowerSwitch as all boards (minus a few Args) have relays now. Deleted "SendSatData" as this was just for testing purposes. Fixed "TrueStage" bug, user shouldn't have issues with the values not "taking" anymore.
'20160128 - MRS Modified the lastgoodbin routine to correctly identify changes in correllation magnitude as well as RSSI.  If profile range exceedes endbin, it no longer gives lastgoodbin as zero.
'               Also changed CorrThreshold to 15 vs 8 to allow for latest program modifications.  Also make sure to set endbin to last valid velocity bin if not lastgoodbin
'20160201 - TAV Added "IsSubmersed" variable to account for situations when we may use a CampbellSci submersible enclosure. If IsSubmersed = True Then use SW12 port to power and cycle ADCP. (No CDMA present)
'20160425 - TAV added code to allow the PT3 command to be parsed out in order to return noise floor for RDI instruments. Had to increase the "Warning" string as well as "SerialIn" command to 2000 to allow for adequate space.
'20160426 - TAV added "NoiseFloor" datatable and a few parameters to the BeamCheck datatable. Noise floor table will be written ONLY with "PT3" command is issued. PT3 command will be automatically once a day per the user's choice, and can be done manually
'20160427 - JBD added Subroutine to obtain external battery voltage from sources larger than 12 volts (36-48 volts)
'20160505 - TAV made a "SiteVisit" record be written when the PT3 command is issued, added YsiWiperPos to know the position of the wiper of the sonde. Useful for WQ processing.
'20160509 - TAV adjusted data types in the QAQC Table for "rVel" and "rStg" from FP2 to IEEE4.
'20160607 - TAV changed all values pertaining to discharge in data tables FROM "Median" to "Average"
'20160627 - JBD added max\min pannel temp to QAQC datatable
'20160629 - TAV dimmed "SelStgUsed" variable so techs CANNOT change primary stage on the fly. They would need to send new program to do so.
'20160711 - TAV finished YsiWiperPos code to alarm techs when the central wiper is outside the housing. Still needs testing! (But won't affect measurements)
'20160721 - TAV Created ConstTable to allow use of this program on either CR1000 or CR6 datalogger. NEED TO CLEAN UP PROGRAM. LOTS OF UNUSED VARIABLES.
'20160823 - MRS\JBD modified the program (hopefully) to work with the VADCP
'20161011 - TAV fixed a couple comport bugs (labelling) for CR6s.
'20161020 - TAV fixed the WakeUpVM to work appropriately with VADCP (needs a "CSTOP" command in order to actually reset instrument". General cleanup, deleted a bunch of unused variables.
'20170403 - TAV added "CardOut" instruction to the SiteVisit table so we would have backups of SiteVisit files.
'20171001 - MRS Program re-designed to Use conditional and custom compile statements and to include Spike detector, EXO serial and EXO burst.
'20180320 - TAV Changed "SiteNum" variable to variable type "String *16" to accomodate short term stations that have long station numbers. Deleted "DiveVisit" stuff. Not really useful anymore.
'20180321 - TAV added a lot of timers around the subroutines for debugging purposes only. Stored every minute in table called "Debugger". Once we're comfortable, we can delete those timers and only keep a couple (ScanStart, ScanEnd, BeforeBurst, AfterBurst, etc.)
'20180323 - TAV Modified the "StoreAllToCard" subroutine to exit the routine if something malfunctioned with the card. Adjusted Data Table sizes to accomodate the "StoreAllToCard" file being written
'               To the card. Current card allocations are: DataOut, Burst, AQ, VelData, BeamCheck: 17280 records (180 days), QAQC and NoiseFloor: 180 records (180 days, unless user activates the NoiseFloor manually)
'               and the SiteVisit table to accomodate 50 records. This allows for ~1.94GB on a 2GB card to be available to the "StoreAllToCard" function.
'               Added ConditionalCompile statements around all WQ variables. If there is no sonde, there's no reason to have the variables populate in the Public table.
'               Created a couple Customize Constants values: "Debugging", "ShowAllVel", and "ShowRawWQ". Allows user to choose whether they want variables associated with those things to be Public or Dim.
'20180329 - MRS Fixed bug causing array out of bounds error if ADCP setup for more than 27 bins. Replaced hard coded 27 with maxbins constant
'20180402 - TAV Fixed bug causing Aquarius table not to write if the logger expected WQ data but the WQ sonde was dead. Added a variable "RecAQFlag". If WQDead AND within 15 sec of 15min mark then RecAQFlag = True
'               Otherwise, resort to normal operation of recording flag with WQ data
'20180405 - TAV Built more timers and counters to narrow down bug causing DataOut to be written every other day. Also reworked how tables are called. Now all data tables are called at the end of the scan, outside of any If...Then statements
'20180406 - TAV Made a user-selectable variable when using the AutoRange function. Now, a user can decide how many bins to cut off at the surface based on their beamchecks. *ONCE IT HAS BEEN RATED, THIS VALUE SHOULD NOT CHANGE!*
'20180509 - TAV Increased WQ "SerialIn" instruction's Max Characters to account for a full suite of sensors/more than 1 parameter per sensor. Set the "GetVariablesFlag" to True in the "Initialize" Sub. Otherwise
'               it wouldn't get called if the system went down and rebooted.
'20180622 - TAV Fixed bug that was disallowing modem to cycle properly. Syntax around Conditional Compile statements regarding SW12 ports was not correct.
'20180706 - TAV Added code to detect "No Sonde" being returned from the SOA. This will put logger into Redeploy mode until a sonde is found.
'20180710 - TAV Added the TrueStage values to the keypad menu.
'               Fixed another Conditional Compile Syntax error regarding the Modem
'               Added SVMaq Table to allow techs to get field visit readings easier without having to scroll through the public table. SVMaq table only stores 1 record.
'               Added IsNClosed to USR variables.
'               Updated BiRating code to allow for use with 3-beam systems that aren't uplookers.
'20180823 - MRS Fixed bug for warning if U ports are used for VM or Sonde on the CR6 using the comms mode 0 option. Put Serialopen commands in subroutines.
'20180824 - MRS Eliminated "baudratehi" and VMbaud is now set in constant menu
'20181018 - TAV added battery voltages (Station, VM, and Wq Sonde) to Aquarius data tables. Added individual sensor stage values to AQ table and removed "StagePrime" and "StageSec". This selection will be done within Aquarius
'               so the changes can be tracked and managed more easily.
'20181114 - MRI created MaxBurstCnt constant, added into constant table so it can be changed more easily. Call burst table when MaxBurstCnt is met and write to Aqurius table.
'20181206 - TAV added Bi-directional rating variables into QAQC Table.
'20181219 - MRI added stagesecnd and selstgsecnd to 1min data table
'20190220 - TAV & MRI reworked entire WQ burst function/loop. It had been reporting 15min late and also not being triggered if the sonde missed the prior 1min punch.
'               Wrote logic to Exit the For...Next... loop if burst values were missed during the burst collection. Still working on logic to COUNT the actual number of values used for the burst. Unless something
'                      happens in the middle of the burst, it's been verified that 30 values are used.
'               Wrote table to sample every value every time through the Burst loop so we have a table stored with each individual sample to verify accuracy of the burst table.
'               Added StdDev, Min, and Max to Burst Table.
'               Now pull median values from the burst table using "MedTempC = Burst.BurstTempC_Med" to populate the AQ table. No sense in having two tables process the exact same functions.
'               Because of how the Median function works, we now "Round" the time of the mid point of the burst. Median is calculated by averaging the two median numbers if the total number of values is even.

'IMPORTANT - SDI-12 Code should be commented out if program is not being used at Freeport Sites.  If program is being used at freeport then the SlaveCom master slave code (used for fish recievers) MUST be commented out
